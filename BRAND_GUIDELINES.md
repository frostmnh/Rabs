# RABS Project - Brand and Trademark Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the RABS project! We appreciate you wanting
to share and discuss our work. These guidelines are designed to help you
understand how you can use the RABS project name and any associated logos or
trademarks (collectively, "RABS Marks") correctly, while also protecting the
integrity and identity of the project.

Our goal is to encourage fair and descriptive use of the RABS Marks, while
preventing uses that could cause confusion or falsely imply an official
endorsement or affiliation with the RABS project or its initiator(s).

## Our Project Identifiers (RABS Marks)

Currently, the primary RABS Mark is the project name:

*   **RABS** (referring to this Remote AUR Build System project)

(If you create a logo in the future, you would add it here, e.g.,
"The RABS Logo [image or description]")

## Permitted Uses (What You CAN Do)

We encourage you to:

1.  **Refer to the RABS project by its name:** You are free to use the name
    "RABS" to accurately describe or refer to our open source project.
    *   *Example:* "I use RABS to build my AUR packages remotely."
    *   *Example:* "This tutorial explains how to set up the RABS server."

2.  **State factual, descriptive information about RABS:** You can accurately
    describe the functionality, features, and purpose of the RABS project.
    *   *Example:* "RABS is a client-server application designed to offload
        AUR package compilation to a remote machine."

3.  **Express your opinion or share your experience with RABS:** We welcome
    you to share your thoughts, whether positive or critical, about the RABS
    project.
    *   *Example:* "I find RABS very useful for managing my AUR builds."
    *   *Example:* "My workflow has improved since I started using RABS."
    *   *Example:* "I created artwork inspired by RABS's concept."

4.  **Develop and distribute software that is compatible with or works with
    RABS:** You can create tools, scripts, or plugins that interact with or
    extend RABS, and accurately state that your software is "for RABS,"
    "works with RABS," or is "RABS-compatible," if true.
    *   *Example:* "This is a RABS client GUI I developed."
    *   *Example:* "My script automates RABS deployment."

5.  **Fair use in academic papers, reviews, articles, and tutorials:** You
    may use the RABS Marks in publications, reviews, and educational
    materials, provided the use is fair and not misleading.

6.  **Describe your work as being "similar to" or "inspired by" RABS (for
    independent projects):** If you are developing your own separate project
    that shares conceptual similarities with RABS, you can describe it as
    such, as long as it's clear that your project is distinct and not an
    official part of RABS or endorsed by us.
    *   *Example:* "Our new build tool is similar in concept to RABS, but
        focuses on a different use case."

## Prohibited Uses (What You CANNOT Do Without Permission)

To avoid confusion and protect the project's identity, you **may not** use
the RABS Marks in the following ways without explicit prior written
permission from the RABS project initiator, **[林定翔] (frostmnh on GitHub)**:

1.  **Implying Official Endorsement, Sponsorship, or Affiliation:** Do not
    use the RABS Marks in any way that suggests an official endorsement,
    sponsorship, partnership, or affiliation with the RABS project or its
    initiator(s), unless such a relationship officially exists and you have
    been authorized.
    *   *Example (Prohibited):* Naming your product "RABS Certified Plugin"
        or "The Official RABS Guide" without permission.
    *   *Example (Prohibited):* Using RABS Marks to make your product look
        like an official RABS offering.

2.  **Confusingly Similar Names or Marks:** Do not use names, logos, or
    domain names that are confusingly similar to the RABS Marks. This
    includes misspellings, phonetic equivalents, or translations that could
    cause users to believe your product or service is an official RABS
    project or is endorsed by us.

3.  **Incorporating RABS Marks into Your Own Trademarks, Product Names,
    Service Names, or Company Names:** You may not use or register, in whole
    or in part, the RABS Marks as part of your own trademarks, product
    names, service names, domain names, or company names.

4.  **Commercial Use that Implies Endorsement:** While RABS is open source,
    using RABS Marks in a commercial product or service in a way that
    implies official endorsement or that your product is an official RABS
    product requires permission. (Fair descriptive use, e.g., "Our service
    helps manage RABS deployments," is generally fine, but avoid anything
    misleading).

5.  **Altering or Modifying RABS Marks:** (Applies more if you have a logo)
    Do not distort, modify, or alter the RABS Marks.

6.  **Use in a Way That Disparages RABS:** While we welcome constructive
    criticism, do not use the RABS Marks in a way that is defamatory,
    libelous, or otherwise disparaging to the RABS project or its
    community.

## Requesting Permission

If your intended use case falls into the "Prohibited Uses" category, or if
you are unsure, please contact us to request permission or clarification.
We are generally open to collaborations and supportive uses, but we need to
ensure they align with the project's identity and goals.

Please contact **frostmnh via GitHub. You can do this by creating an Issue
in the RABS project repository, or by checking the contact information on
the frostmnh GitHub profile.** for any questions regarding these
guidelines or to request permission for specific uses.

## Reservation of Rights

The RABS project initiator(s) reserve all rights to the RABS Marks. We may
update these guidelines from time to time. Your continued use of the RABS
Marks constitutes your acceptance of any such updates.
